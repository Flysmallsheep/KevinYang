Thank you for navigating Kevin's Projects!

1.Project Aim and Scope:
Project Aim:
For users:
The aim of this mobile web application is developing overall fitness for general public. Essentially, this app is a location-tracking app, it will track your current location and return a random location nearby, then the user have to run to the destination in order to begin the next run. During this whole process, the user will enhance their cardiopulmonary capacity so that the consumers could have more chances to prevent the heart, brain, and blood diseases. Also, if the users bring friends or family with during the run, it can also improve the relationship between the people as working out together, what a great deal!
For developers:
During the process of developing this web app, my teammates and me gains a lot on programing skills, learning ability, collaborating techniques, task management, good documentation and how to face the difficulties.
1.Programming and learning skills:
This app development definitely give us the experience how a real world app would look like and how it works, It give us the basic understanding how javascript can control and modify the geoLocation that would works on users. During the whole process, we have to do lots of research from stack-overflow, Github, geeksforgeeks, etc. Potentially, we absorb plenty of deep understanding and thoughts for web programming.
2.Task management and collaborating techniques:
As a team leader, is my responsibility to ensure that the tasks allocation is fair to every team members and the arrangement of the task is efficient and effective. so according to the 9 functionality, I chose to divide them by three and allocate them to each team contributor. During the project develop time, we communicate and collaborate with each other by mainly wechat, also for the task management and code version control, we used asana and gitkraken in order to make sure the tasks are on track and under control.
3.Good documentation and difficulties:
In order to keep the neatness of the code, we communicate with each other and give a common view on which we all should make the comment on the tasks or functionalities and give variables meaningful and unambiguous declaration in order to prevent confusion. The difficulties for us are the debugging process, we have to use the debugger tool on Chrome and step through each line of code to check where the bug located at. That is a tough process, however, potentially, it give us the enhancement of thinking skills, pattern and debugging experience that we might take the advantage when we walk into the IT industry in the future.
Project Scope:
This app literally is a javascript-based mobile app that works on modern browser, my teammates and me use the MDL in order to make the interface that on the mobile users looks a lot better in order to improve the user experience.
The project is finished until we noticed that the application have capacity to achieve all the functionalities mentioned in the task instruction, the app should be able to display user initial location and generate a random nearby location, begin and complete a run and track all the details, store them into local storage, and view or modify all the run details.
This application works on a variety of platforms, such as laptop, mobile phone and iPad that which have GPS capacity built- in, it also have lots of constraints, for example, it is only single-user app, can not be used simultaneously among multiple users and also can not be used on the devices that do not have the GPS such as switch game console, etc.â€©

2.Team members and responsibilities:
Team members that we have are Kevin, Camp, Kim, John and Alex. For me, in this tasks, my responsibilities is to equally divide the task and allocation them to the members. 
3.How to do the projects, e.g., team meetings, gitkraken, asana, wechat.
We do the team meetings regularly in wechat group chat and also the zoom meetings. So we are able to share the ideas and code with other team members, once we have a task completed, we notify others in the team in order to give others the progress that I am currently at, ensure that the progress line is not be forgotten. For the code version control, we used gitKraken, constantly update the code each time we would make changes on the tasks. For team tasks allocation, we used Asana to allocate the resources and tasks, keep track of what others doing and constantly monitoring the team project progress.
4.Information you would give to a new team member
Firstly, I would let him to know the basic rules that we have in our team: 1. Constantly check asana messages in order to catch up any the information that could share to the team to complete the project
2. Have good team documentation in order tolet the team clearly know what your code is doing
3. Update your code regularly on gitkraken,and lookup the task on the Asana. Once complete, please tick the box and let the team know
4. If have difficulties,please email or send a quick message to the CTO or the team, we as one part, we should work together.


That's all, Thank you!
